# React Native Learning Journey

This repository is a collection of my learning projects and experiments with React Native. The journey started on **4th September 2024** and is ongoing as I explore various technologies and approaches in mobile app development.

## Directory Structure

- **Core Native App**:  
  This folder contains projects built using core React Native, focusing on understanding the core APIs, native modules, and building apps that can be deployed to both iOS and Android platforms.

- **Expo Go**:  
  Contains projects built using Expo Go, which allows for a quicker setup and development experience, especially for rapid prototyping and learning React Native basics.

**Getting Started**
```bash
npx create-expo-app hello-world-expo-go --template blank
```
**Running the Projects**
```bash
npx expo start
```

## Future Plans

As I continue my learning journey, I plan to add more projects and explore different aspects of mobile app development, including:

- Advanced React Native features
- Integrating third-party libraries and native code
- Performance optimization
- State management (Redux, Context API, etc.)
- Testing and deployment workflows

Stay tuned as I expand this repository with more exciting technologies!
