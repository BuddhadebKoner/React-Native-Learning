# React Native Learning Journey

This repository is a collection of my learning projects and experiments with React Native. The journey started on **4th September 2024** and is ongoing as I explore various technologies and approaches in mobile app development.

## Directory Structure

- **Core Native App**:  
  This folder contains projects built using core React Native, focusing on understanding the core APIs, native modules, and building apps that can be deployed to both iOS and Android platforms.

- **Expo Go**:  
  Contains projects built using Expo Go, which allows for a quicker setup and development experience, especially for rapid prototyping and learning React Native basics.

**Getting Started**
```bash
npx create-expo-app hello-world-expo-go --template blank
```
**Running the Projects**
```bash
npx expo start
```
**see java and node are processing**
```bash
pgrep -fl node
pgrep -fl java
```
**kill the process**
```bash
kill -9 <process_id>
```
